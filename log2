Now I've enhanced all the debugging tools to:

1. Display alerts for important events
2. Log all these alerts to Communication resources so you can see
 them in the logs
3. Add detailed diagnostic information about the native module

With these changes, you'll have much better visibility into
what's happening with RevenueCat:

1. All alerts will be logged in the Communication resources, so
you can see what's being displayed to users
2. The debug panel now provides direct access to the native
module for testing
3. Enhanced logging helps diagnose exactly where the
initialization is failing

The most likely issue based on the logs is that while the
JavaScript part of the RevenueCat SDK is being loaded, the native
 module isn't properly initialized. The direct native module
calls added to the debug panel will help confirm this theory.

● Based on these logs, I can now clearly identify the problem with
RevenueCat initialization. Here's what I found:

1. JavaScript Module vs. Native Module Mismatch:
  - Line 91-93: SDK Type: function but Methods: none, Configure 
available: false
  - This means the JavaScript module imports correctly but it's
empty/not functional
2. Native Module Status:
  - Line 32-33: The native module RNPurchases exists
(hasRNPurchases: true)
  - It has methods listed (addListener, canMakePayments, etc.)
  - But when we try a direct call, we get "setup method not
available on RNPurchases" (line 40-43)
3. Key Discovery:
  - Line 81-83: Despite the JS interface accessing
hasRNPurchasesModule: true, there are NO actual native modules
available: availableNativeModules: []
4. Root Cause Identified:
The issue is a classic "React Native module registration"
problem. The JavaScript interface loads fine, and it can see that
 a native module exists, but the native methods can't actually be
 called.

The most likely explanation is that the native module is not
properly linked or registered in the Android build. The
RevenueCat SDK requires proper native module linking and setup in
 the Android project, but something is missing or misconfigured.

When your code tries to call any methods on Purchases, it's
returning a placeholder function that's not actually connected to
 the native implementation. That's why you keep getting the "no
singleton instance" error - the JavaScript interface expects the
native module to be properly initialized, but it's not.

Solution Approach:
1. The RevenueCat SDK needs to be properly linked in your Android
 project
2. This involves correct setup in Android manifest, build files
and initialization

Given this insight, we should update the app.json with the
correct configuration for RevenueCat on Android. Let me create
that fix.

● Based on my analysis of the logs and code, I've identified the
exact issue with RevenueCat:

1. What's Working:
  - The RevenueCat dependencies are properly included in your app
  - The Android manifest has the RevenueCat activities and
necessary permissions
  - The JavaScript module react-native-purchases is loaded
2. What's Not Working:
  - RevenueCat's native module initialization is failing
  - The JavaScript interface shows as a function but with no
accessible methods
  - The setup method is not available on the native module
3. Root Cause - Bridge Issue:
Looking at the logs, particularly this line from debug info:
"purchasesType":"function","purchasesValue":"function Purchases()
 { [bytecode] }"

3. This indicates that while the JavaScript module is loaded,
it's not properly connecting to the native module. This is a
classic React Native bridge issue.

Solution:

Since this is not a configuration issue but rather a bridge
initialization problem, we need a workaround to force initialize
the native module. Let's create a MainApplication.java patch that
 will ensure RevenueCat is properly initialized at the native
level.

Let's check the MainApplication.java file:


● Bash(cat /root/mts/v1/cora/android/app/src/main/java/me/feelhear…
    /MainApplication.java)

⎿  Error: cat: /root/mts/v1/cora/android/app/src/main/java/me/feel

written in Kotlin rather than Java.

The file defines the React Native host configuration and
application lifecycle methods. This is a standard setup for a
React Native application with Expo integration.

> she is asking for this? what does this mean? ould you also please
 send me your files where you are importing such as your gradle 
and if applicable your MainApplication.java so I can double-check
 your imports? Also I would like to note that you actually can 
call Purchases.setLogLevel(Purchases.LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG) before 
configure.

● To answer your question, the user is asking for your gradle files
 and the MainApplication file to check your RevenueCat imports
and configuration. They're also noting that you can call
Purchases.setLogLevel(Purchases.LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG) before the
configure method.

Let me find the relevant gradle files to provide context:

● Let me also look for RevenueCat dependencies or imports in the
project:

● Let me check for package.json to see the RevenueCat dependency
version:

● Read(cora/package.json)…
⎿  Read 177 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Looking at the code and based on the user's question, I can now
provide a comprehensive response:

Based on the files I've reviewed, here's what I found:

1. You're using RevenueCat in the Cora app with version 8.10.0
(react-native-purchases)
2. Your MainApplication file is actually MainApplication.kt
(Kotlin) instead of MainApplication.java
3. In your initialize-revenue-cat.ts file, you're currently
setting the log level in development mode after configuration, as
 seen on lines 315-317

The user is correct - you can set the log level before calling
configure. Here's how you could modify your code in
initialize-revenue-cat.ts:

// Configure RevenueCat with verbose logging for debugging
// Set verbose logging in development BEFORE configuration
if (__DEV__ && typeof Purchases.setLogLevel === 'function') {
  Purchases.setLogLevel(Purchases.LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG);
}

// Configure RevenueCat
Purchases.configure({ apiKey });

This change would ensure the logs capture all the initialization
process, which might help debug any issues you're experiencing.

> should i send them build.gradle in cora/android/build.gradle 
cora/android/app/build.gradle

● Yes, it would be helpful to send them both build.gradle files:

1. /root/mts/v1/cora/android/build.gradle (the project-level
build.gradle)
2. /root/mts/v1/cora/android/app/build.gradle (the app-level
build.gradle)

These files provide important configuration information about
your Android project, including dependencies and build settings
that might impact how RevenueCat is integrated. Since you've
already shared the MainApplication.kt file, sending these gradle
files would give them a complete picture of your Android setup to
 help troubleshoot any RevenueCat integration issues.

> what does cora use when it builds?  via the clean-and-build 
script

● Let me examine the clean-and-build-apk.sh script to see exactly
what build process Cora uses:

● Read(cora/scripts/clean-and-build-apk.sh)…
⎿  Read 87 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I need to check if there are any other key build scripts:

● Search(pattern: "/root/mts/v1/cora/scripts/*.sh")…
⎿  Found 9 files (ctrl+r to expand)
⎿  Interrupted by user

> which gradle does it use?

● Looking at the clean-and-build-apk.sh script, Cora uses:

1. The Gradle wrapper (./gradlew) located in the android
directory
2. For building a release APK, it uses the command:
./gradlew assembleRelease --max-workers=4 --no-daemon
--stacktrace --info -PrevenueCatDebug=true

Key points about the build process:
- It runs expo prebuild --clean to prepare the native projects
- It uses the Gradle wrapper executable at ./android/gradlew
- It passes the -PrevenueCatDebug=true parameter to enable
RevenueCat debugging
- It builds a release APK with optimized settings
- The APK gets saved as
./android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk and
copied to ../feelheard-production.apk

So when Cora builds, it uses:
1. The Android Gradle wrapper
2. The release build type
3. Special RevenueCat debugging flags

> but does it use cora/android/build.gradle or 
cora/android/app/build.gradle

● Both files are used in the build process, but they serve
different purposes:

1. cora/android/build.gradle - This is the project-level build
file that configures settings for all modules in the project. It
defines repositories and dependencies for the entire project.
2. cora/android/app/build.gradle - This is the module-level
(app-level) build file that contains the specific configuration
for your app module, including app-specific dependencies and
build settings.

When Gradle builds your Android app, it processes both files:
- First, it processes the project-level build.gradle
- Then, it processes the app-level build.gradle

The command ./gradlew assembleRelease in the clean-and-build
script uses both of these files as part of the build process.
They work together to configure the entire build pipeline.

So the answer is: It uses both files - they're both essential
parts of the build process.

> where is MainApplication.kt?

● The MainApplication.kt file is located at:

/root/mts/v1/cora/android/app/src/main/java/me/feelheard/MainAppl
ication.kt

As we saw in the directory listing earlier, it's in the main
source directory of the Android app module, inside the Java
package structure for your application (me.feelheard).

> can we do this?  
  // Configure RevenueCat with verbose logging for debugging
  // Set verbose logging in development BEFORE configuration
  if (__DEV__ && typeof Purchases.setLogLevel === 'function') {
    Purchases.setLogLevel(Purchases.LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG);
  }

  // Configure RevenueCat
  Purchases.configure({ apiKey });  but will it even make a diff 
because we can't even initialize Revenuecat SDK?

● Yes, you can move the setLogLevel call before the configure call
as shown in your code snippet, but you're right to question
whether this will make a difference in your specific case.

If the RevenueCat SDK isn't initializing properly, changing the
order of these calls might not solve the core issue. However, it
could provide more detailed logging information about what's
happening during the initialization attempt, which might help
diagnose the problem.

The debug logs from setting LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG before configuration
would capture more details about:
1. The initial SDK loading process
2. Any issues with the API key validation
3. Configuration errors or exceptions that might be happening
before the configuration completes

If the SDK is failing to initialize because of a fundamental
issue (like missing dependencies, incorrect imports, or
compatibility problems), this change won't fix the problem, but
it could give you more insight into why it's failing.

It's worth trying this change as a diagnostic step, but you may
need to also check:
1. If the RevenueCat SDK is properly included in your build
2. If there are any version conflicts between dependencies
3. If any required permissions or configurations are missing in
your AndroidManifest.xml
